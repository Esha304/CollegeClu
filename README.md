## Overview
### Description

### App Evaluation
- **Category**: Entertainment/Social Networking
- **Mobile:** Mobile version will have more features like using camera to put your profile pic, post it, use of maps and also maybe call someone from getting their number.
- **Story:** People basically finds it difficult to look for any game/event to plan their weekend at the very last point with planning of how to go/reach there so this app is basically all in one which even helps you to find someone that can join you. 
- **Market:** Anyone can use it. 
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often or unoften depending on the user.
- **Scope:** This can perhaps evolve into one-in-all app where you can even plan events with unknowns and basically meet new people and hang out with them.
