## Overview
### Description
Helps you with finding Events happening in your selected city, with buying tickets, lets you post it like instagram to see who else's coming and helps you with finding the easiest way to reach there using maps.

### App Evaluation
- **Category**: Entertainment/Social Networking
- **Mobile:** Mobile version will have more features like using camera to put your profile pic, post it, use of maps and also maybe call someone from getting their number.
- **Story:** People basically finds it difficult to look for any game/event to plan their weekend at the very last point with planning of how to go/reach there so this app is basically all in one which even helps you to find someone that can join you. 
- **Market:** Anyone can use it. 
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often or unoften depending on the user.
- **Scope:** This can perhaps evolve into one-in-all app where you can even plan events with unknowns and basically meet new people and hang out with them.
